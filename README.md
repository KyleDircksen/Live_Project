# Live_Project

Hi, Welcome to my Repository for my Live Project while working with The Tech Academy.

This Repository will consist of solutions to User Stories from working on an Agile team. This will consist of data cleaning and normalization, data analysis, statistical testing, as well as written reports based upon my findings.

Many of the files included are for testing for a correlation within the Google Play Store by utilizing Python. The goal was to determine if any of the categories of apps had a correlation between price of the app and the amount of downloads it recieved for each category sepereately. After cleaning the data properly and preparing the data for analysis I decided the best fitting statistical test for the problems would be the Pearson Coefficient and Simple Regression testing. After testing I included relevant visualizations and a report which discusses the data, methodology, analysis, and findings for each category.

Additionally, one of the files is focused on data from Mount Rainier climbing routes and weather data which was done by utilizing R. My job was to clean and prepare the data for model creation in order to predict the success rate of a particular route on any given day. The best model for this task would be a Time Series model given the constraints of the data and in order to prepare this NA imputation was needed on some of the weather data in order to increase the accuracy of the model.

I hope you enjoy looking over my projects!
